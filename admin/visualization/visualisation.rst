Network maps
============

Network map objects can be found in "Object browser" under "Network Maps". There can be
created and deleted maps and map groups. Maps can be organized in groups.

.. figure:: ../_images/Network_maps_in_object_browser.png

Creating Maps
-------------

There are 3 types of map that can be created:
   * Custom - will be created empty map.
   * Layer 2 Topology - will create map(if possible) with layer 2 topology of selected object. Will be automatically updated on topology change.
   * IP Topology - will create map with known IP Topology of selected object. (More about network topology can be found there :ref:`topology`) Will be automatically updated on topology change.
   * Internal communication topology - map created based on internal communication between server and node (will show SNMP, ICMP, ).

.. figure:: ../_images/network_map_l2.png

   Network map layer 2

Type of created map affects only on initial map setup.

Edit Maps
---------

.. figure:: ../_images/network_map_menu.png

Adding Objects
--------------

Network map can be populated in 2 different ways: automatically and manually.
Automatically are populated Layer 2, IP Topology and Internal communication topology.
Object filer (in properties of the map) can be created for automatically populated
maps to filter out unrequited nodes.

Objects to map can be added in tow ways:
   1. Just drag and drop object to map from object browser.
   2. "Add object..." from menu.

To remove object from map:
   * Select object, right click and select "Remove from map" option.

Adding Links between Objects
----------------------------

Objects can be linked with a line.


To link objects:
   * Select two of objects with help of CTRL button and press "Link selected objects" button.

.. figure:: ../_images/network_map_top_menu.png

To remove the link:
   * Select line, right click and select "Remove from map" option.


**Link properties:**

Select link line, right click and select "Properties".


The following properties can be configured:
   * Link name
   * Connector names (shown on the link line near each connected object)
   * Line color
      * Default - grey
      * Based on object status - object(s) should be selected
      * Custom color
   * Routing algorithm
      * Map Default - algorithm selected in map properties will be used
      * Direct - straight line without bend points
      * Manhattan - line with automatic bend points
      * Bend points - bend point can be added manually with double click on the
        line
   * Label position - defines position of label containing link name and DCI
     values on the link. 50 means middle of the link.
   * Data Source (allows to configure DCI values and text near them that will be
     displayed on a link).
   * For each Data Source can be configured: Data collection item, name,
     format string, in case of table DCI also column and instance. If format
     string is not provided, default formatting including multipliers and
     measurement units is used.

     Java format string syntax is used, e.g. ``Text: %.4f``, syntax description
     is available here:
     http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html#syntax.

     Additional format specifier can be provided in curly brackets after
     ``%`` sign to display multipliers and measurement units, e.g.
     ``%{units,multipliers}f``.

     Format specifier is comma-separated list supporting the following options:

       - ``units`` - add measurement units from DCI's properties. For
         :guilabel:`Epoch` time and :guilabel:`Uptime` this will also convert
         the value.
       - ``u`` - same as ``units``
       - ``multipliers`` - display values with multipliers (e.g. 1230000
         becomes 1.23 M)
       - ``m`` - same as ``multipliers``

Example of DCI data displayed on a link:

.. figure:: ../_images/link_dci_data.png

Decorations
-----------

Decorations like picture and group box can be added to maps.
To add picture it should be previously be uploaded to "Image Library".


When creating group box you should specify it's size, color and name.


.. figure:: ../_images/network_map_decorations.png


DCI Container
-------------
DCI Container is part of decorations. It can be used to display separate dci values
on a map.

.. figure:: ../_images/dci_container_example.png

**Container properties:**

   * Background color
   * Text color
   * If border should be shown and it's color
   * Data Source - there can be configured DCI values and text near them that will be displayed
      * For each Data Source can be configured: Data collection item,  name,
        format string (e.g. "Text: %.4f" or "Text: %*s"),  in case of table DCI also column and
        instance

More examples:

.. figure:: ../_images/dci_container_example2.png


DCI Image
---------
DCI Image is part of decorations. It can be used to display DCI status change in pictures.


**DCI image properties**
   * Data source - DCI which data will be taken to process picture display rules
   * Column - required only for table DCI
   * Instance - required only for table DCI
   * Default image - image that will be displayed if no rule is applicable on current value
   * Rules
      * For each rule can be configured: operation,  value,  comment and image that will be displayed if this rule is applicable

Hints:

To use image it should be first uploaded to image library.


Rules are processed from up to down, so if you want to describe in rules
something like:

   * DCI > 3 => image1
   * DCI > 2 => image2
   * DCI > 4 => image3

They should go in this sequence:

   * DCI > 4 => image3
   * DCI > 3 => image1
   * DCI > 2 => image2


Object Layout and display options
---------------------------------
All object layout properties and display options are applicable only on objects,
not on decorations.


Grid
~~~~
   * Align to grid - will move all objects to grids
   * Snap to grid - all objects will be moved in grids and it will not be possible to place them not inside grid.
   * Show grid - will show grid according to which objects are located.

.. figure:: ../_images/network_map_top_menu.png


Layout
~~~~~~
Objects can be placed manually on a map or can be chosen one of automatic layouts:
   * Spring
   * Radial
   * Horizontal tree
   * Vertical tree
   * Sparse vertical tree


If there is chosen automatic layout, then after each refresh object best matching place
will be recalculated. So if new object is add - it is just required to refresh map to have
correctly placed objects.


If there is chosen manual layout, then after each object movement map should be saved,
to save the new place of object.


Display object as
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   * Show status background - will display background behind object image according to it's state.
   * Show status icon - will display icon of object state near each object
   * Show status frame - will display frame around object icon according to it's state
   * Floor plan - will display nodes as adjustable rectangles. This can be used to display hardware placement on room plan.


Routing
~~~~~~~
Default routing type for whole map:
   * Direct - objects are connected by links drawn to shortest route
   * Manhattan - objects are connected by grid-based links


Zoom
~~~~
Map can be zoomed in and out with help of top menu buttons and
to predefined percentage selected from menu.


Object display options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Objects can be displayed in 3 ways:
   * Icons
   * Small labels
   * Large labels


Map Background
--------------
It can be set background for map:
   * Colour
   * Image - image should be uploaded to "Image Library" before.
   * Geographic Map - place on map is chose with help of zoom and coordinates


This can be used to show object physical please on map or on building plan.

Dashboards
==========

Dashboards are defined by administrator and allow to combine any available
visualization components with data from multiple sources in order to create
high-level views to see network (or parts of it) health at a glance. For
example, below is a dashboard showing traffic information from core router, as
well as CPU usage from vital nodes:

.. figure:: ../_images/DashboardExample.png

There are two ways to access dashboards:

Open dashboard from Object Browser

- Open dashboard from :guilabel:`Object Browser`
- Switch to :guilabel:`Dashboard` perspective and select dashboard with
  left-click

Configuration
-------------

Dashboards is a special type of objects created in :guilabel:`Dashboards` tree.
To create a new dashboard, right click on :guilabel:`Dashboards` root object or
any other existing dashboard and select :guilabel:`Create dashboard`. To
configure dashboard content, open object's properties and go to
:guilabel:`Dashboard Elements:guilabel:` page. Here you can define number of
columns and manage list of elements. Press :guilabel:`Add:guilabel:` to add new
element. You will be prompted with element type selection dialog:

.. figure:: ../_images/DashboardProperties.png

When a new element is added, you can edit it by double-clicking on it's record in
the elements list, or by pressing the :guilabel:`Edit` button. Each element have
:guilabel:`Layout` property page which controls the element's layout inside the
dashboard, and one or more element type specific pages to control element's
appearance and displayed information. The following element types are

Object query
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shows columns with filtered objects' information.

Object query has 2 main configurations. :guilabel:`Query` that filterers objects and provide option to create
additional information about object in columns and :guilabel:`Object Properties` that lists information that
should be shown in table.

**Query**

It is a script that is executed on each object and should return true if object should be displayed in the table
and false if it should not. It has special syntax that provides option to calculate additional values for columns
in :guilabel:`Object Properties` section. This syntax is optional and usual NXSL script can be used instead. Usual
NXSL script should return true or map (where key is column name and value is value for this column) if node should
be shown and false if not, additional self calculated columns can be defined as global variables.

Syntax:

.. code-block::

  with
    varName = { code or expression },
    varName = { code or expression }
    /* Might be as many blocks as required.
     * varName is a name of the variable where result of a code will be assigned.
     * It can be used later in the code in expression or to be displayed in table
     * using the same name in the Object Properties part.
    */
  expression
  /* Short circuit evaluated expression. This expression is executed first and if it contains not yet calculated
   * varName then variable is calculated and used in expression. Expression that should result as true or false
   * as a sign if this object should be displayed in table or not. No semicolon at the end.
  */

This page provides option to configure columns that should be used for ordering,
refresh interval and record limit. To order column write a coma separated list of attribute named or varNames with
- sign to order in descending order and with + sign to order in ascending order.

**Object Properties**

This property page is used to organize required columns and column order in table.
Each column configuration consists of name of object's attribute or varName defined
in Query page, display name used as a name for a column and data type of the column.

**Example**

This example will show how to filter nodes that only have alarms on them, are not in maintenance mode and show count of
critical alarms on the node, order by critical alarm count the list and then by node name. Example shows two different
options how to write the same script so only one of them should be used.

Configuration:

.. figure:: ../_images/dashboard_object_query_query.png

  Option 1. Query script with "with" syntax

.. figure:: ../_images/dashboard_object_query_query2.png

  Option 2. Query script  with usual NXSL script and global variables

.. figure:: ../_images/dashboard_object_query_object_properties.png

  Configuration of :guilabel:`Properties to display` will be the same for both scripts

Result:

.. figure:: ../_images/dashboard_object_query.png

Port view
~~~~~~~~~
Shows ports schematic with each port status.
One object or a container that contains required objects can be set as root object.

.. figure:: ../_images/dashboard_port_view.png

~~~~~~~~

:guilabel`Web Page` property page is available for web page type elements. Here
you can define URL to be displayed and optional title. If title is not empty,
it will be displayed above page content.


.. _dashboards-layout:

Understanding Element Layout
----------------------------

Dashboard uses grid concept to layout it's elements. Available space is divided
into rows and columns, and each element occupies one or more cells. The number of
columns is configured in dashboard object properties, and number of rows is
calculated automatically based on number of columns, elements, and
cells occupied by each element. Elements are laid out in columns from
left to right, and a new row is created when there are no space left for next
element on current row. Each element has horizontal and vertical alignment
properties. Default for both is :guilabel:`FILL`. Possible alignment values are
following:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Value
     - Description
   * - FILL
     - Make element to fill whole cell. Also causes to grab excess free space
       available inside dashboard. If more than one element is trying to grab
       the same space, then the excess space is shared evenly among the
       grabbing elements.
   * - CENTER
     - Center element within cell.
   * - LEFT/TOP
     - Align element to left/top of the cell.
   * - RIGHT/BOTTOM
     - Align element to right/bottom of the cell.

   Complex layout configuration

This configuration will be rendered into this layout:

.. image:: ../_images/DashboardComplexLayoutExample.png

Dashboard Rotation
------------------

To create configuration when management client displays multiple dashboards one by one in
a loop, follow these steps:

- Create all dashboards you want to show
- Create additional dashboard object, with single element of type
  :guilabel:`Dashboard` inside
- Add all dashboards you want to show to dashboard list of that element and set
  desired time between changing dashboards.

.. figure:: ../_images/DashboardRotationConfig.png

   Sample configuration of two dashboards displayed in a loop for 40 seconds each.

Graphs
======

You can view collected data in a graphical form, as a line chart. To view
values of some DCI as a chart, first open either :guilabel:`Data Collection`
Editor or :guilabel:`Last Values` view for a host. You can do it from the
:guilabel:`Object Browser` or map by selection host, right-clicking on it, and
selecting :guilabel:`Data collection` or :guilabel:`Last DCI values`. Then,
select one or more DCIs (you can put up to 16 DCIs on one graph), right-click
on them and choose :guilabel:`Graph` from the pop-up menu. You will see
graphical representation of DCI values for the last hour.

When the graph is open, you can do various tasks:

Select different time interval
------------------------------

By default, you will see data for the last hour. You can select different time
interval in two ways:

#. Select new time interval from presets, by right-clicking on the graph, and
   then selecting :guilabel:`Presets` and appropriate time interval from the
   pop-up menu.
#. Set time interval in graph properties dialog. To access graph properties,
   right-click on the graph, and then select :guilabel:`Properties` from the
   pop-up menu. Alternatively, you can use main application menu:
   :menuselection:`Graph --> Properties`. In the properties dialog, you will
   have two options: select exact time interval (like ``12/10/2005 from 10:00
   to 14:00``) or select time interval based on current time (like ``last two
   hours``).

Turn on automatic refresh
-------------------------

You can turn on automatic graph refresh at a given interval in graph properties
dialog. To access graph properties, right-click on it, and select
:guilabel:`Properties` from the pop-up menu. Alternatively, you can use main
application menu: :menuselection:`Graph --> Properties`. In the properties
dialog, select the :guilabel:`Refresh automatically` checkbox and enter a
desired refresh interval in seconds in edit box below. When automatic refresh
is on, you will see :guilabel:`Autoupdate` message in the status bar of graph
window.


Change colors
-------------

You can change colors used to paint lines and graph elements in the graph
properties dialog. To access graph properties, right-click on it, and select
:guilabel:`Properties` from the pop-up menu. Alternatively, you can use main
application menu: :menuselection:`Graph --> Properties`. In the properties
dialog, click on colored box for appropriate element to choose different color.


Save current settings as predefined graph
-----------------------------------------

You can save current graph settings as predefined graph to allow quick and easy
access in the future to information presented on graph. Preconfigured graphs
can be used either by you or by other |product_name| users, depending on settings. To
save current graph configuration as predefined graph, select :guilabel:`Save`
as predefined from graph view menu. The following dialog will appear:

.. figure:: ../_images/define_graph.png

In :guilabel:`Graph name` field, enter desired name for your predefined graph.
It will appear in predefined graph tree exactly as written here. You can use
``->`` character pair to create subtree. For example, if you name your graph
``NetXMS Server->System->CPU utilization (iowait)`` it will appear in the tree
as following:

.. figure:: ../_images/predefined_graph_tree.png

You can edit predefined graph by right-clicking on it in predefined graph tree,
and selecting :guilabel:`Properties` from context menu. On
:guilabel:`Predefined Graph` property page you can add users and groups who
will have access to this graph. Note that user creating the graph will always
have full access to it, even if he is not in access list.

If you need to delete predefined graph, you can do it by right-clicking on it
in predefined graph tree, and selecting :guilabel:`Delete` from context menu.


Save current settings as template graph
---------------------------------------

.. figure:: ../_images/save_as_temp_graph.png

Current graph settings can be saved as a template graph for an easy template graph creation. The difference between predefined graphs and template graphs are that template graphs are not configured to view specific DCI`s on a node, instead they are configured to view DCI names that can be found on many nodes (e.g. ``FileSystem.FreePerc(/)``). This allows for the creation of certain graph templates to monitor, for example, disk usage that can be reused on any node to which the appropreate DCI`s are applied on via :ref:`dci-configuration`.

See detailed information on template graphs in the section :ref:`template-graph-conf`.

In the Graph name field of the pop-up save dialog, enter the desired name for the template graph by which you can later identify your it in the :ref:`template-graph-conf` which can be found in :menuselection:`Configuration-->Template Graph Configuration`.

.. figure:: ../_images/temp_graph_menu.png

Template graphs can be accessed in the :guilabel:`Object Browser` as seen on the screenshot above. When a template graph is created, it will appear in the sub-menus of the nodes found in :guilabel:`Object Browser`, the rest of the settings can be accessed by editing a template graph in the :ref:`template-graph-conf`.

.. _template-graph-conf:

Template Graph Configuration
----------------------------

Template graphs are used to ease the monitoring of a pre-set list of DCI`s on multiple nodes by adding a list of DCI names to the template source. This allows for the possibility to create templates to monitor specific data on any node to which the appropriate DCI`s are applied on.

.. figure:: ../_images/temp_graph_conf.png

The :guilabel:`Template Graph Configuration` is used to create and edit template graphs. Properties for already created template graphs can be brought up by double clicking the template graph you wish to edit and new ones can be added by pressing the green cross on the top right or by right clicking and selecting :guilabel:`Create new template graph`.

.. figure:: ../_images/temp_graph_conf_acl.png

	Name and access rights of a graph

The above property page provides the possibility to configure the name of the template graph and the access rights. The user who has created the template graph will have full access to it even though the username will not show up in the access right list.

.. figure:: ../_images/temp_graph_conf_gen.png

	General graph properties.

Title:

	- The title that the graph will have when opened.
	- The title can contain special characters described in :ref:`object_tools_macro`.

Provides the possibility to configure the time period of the graph. It is possible to set a dynamic time frame (Back from now) and a static time frame (Fixed time frame).

Y Axis Range:

Adjust the range of the Y axis on the graph.

	Template graph filter properties.

It may be necessary to set certain filters for a template graph. This can be useful if the graph contains DCI names that are only available on |product_name| agent or are SNMP dependant.

More information on filters can be found in :ref:`object_tools_filter`.

	Template graph sources

There are two options to add sources to the template graph. Sources can be added manually by configuring the Data Source parameters yourself or by importing data source information from DCI`s that have already been applied to other nodes.

.. figure:: ../_images/temp_graph_conf_modify.png

When adding or editing a source, it is possible to use Java regex in the DCI Name and DCI Description fields. This can be handy when used with the Multiple match option which will use all DCI`s that match the particular regex. The order in which the DCI list is searched is first by DCI Name and then by DCI Description.

History
=======

You can view collected data in a textual form, as a table with two columns -
:guilabel:`timestamp` and :guilabel:`value`. To view values of some DCI as a
table, first open either :guilabel:`Data Collection Editor` or :guilabel:`Last
Values` view for a host. You can do it from the :guilabel:`Object Browser` or
map by selection host, right-clicking on it, and selecting :guilabel:`Data
collection` or :guilabel:`Last DCI values`. Then, select one or more DCIs (each
DCI data will be shown in separate view), right-click on them and choose
:guilabel:`Show history` from the pop-up menu. You will see the last 1000
values of the DCI.

Summary table
=============

It is possible to see DCI data as a table where each line is one node and each
column is a DCI. It can be configured for each summary table which DCIs should be
present on it.

.. figure:: ../_images/summary_table.png

Configuration
-------------

DCI summary table can be configured in Configuration -> Summary Table.

.. figure:: ../_images/configure_dci_summary_table.png

General:

  - Menu path - path where this summary table can be found. You can use
    ``->`` character pair to create subtree like "Linux->System information".
  - Title - title of the summary table.

Columns:

  - This is the list if DCI's that will be shown on the summary table.
    Name is the name of column and DCI Name is DCI parameter name.

     - Multivalued column is intended to present string DCIs that contain several
       values divided by specified separator. Each value is presented on a separate line in the column.
     - If **Use regular expression for parameter name matching** is enabled, a regular expression is specified in **DCI name** field.
       If several DCIs will be matched on a node, only one will be displayed.
  - Import button allows to select a DCI from existing object.


Filter:
  - Filter script is executed for each node to determine, if that node should be included in a summary table.
    Filter script is defined with help of :term:`NXSL` scripting language.


Usage
-----

After DCI summary table is configured it can be accessed in container
object (Subnet, container...) context menu under "Summary tables".
