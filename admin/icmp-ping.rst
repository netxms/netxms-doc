ICMP ping
=========

The following options exist to monitor systems using ICMP pings:

* ICMP response statistic collection
* Metrics provided by ping subagent


ICMP response statistic collection
==================================

|product_name| can periodically perform ICMP polls and calculate node
availability statistics. This functionality can be controlled globally via
server configuration parameter ``ICMP.CollectPollStatistics`` or locally on each
node. ICMP polling interval and statistic calculation period (expressed in
number of polls), timeout and ICMP packet size are configured via server
configuration parameters, see :ref:`server_configuration_parameters`.

ICMP requests are sent to node's primary IP address. Additional targets can be
specified in node's properties. It's also possible to set node's interfaces as
targets by enabling :guilabel:`Collect ICMP response statistic for this
interface` in properties of the interface (enabling this for interface that
corresponds to primary IP address will lead to pinging this address twice).

ICMP polling is performed from server, from a zone proxy if zoning is used or
from specific proxy if it's configured in node properties. Proxying agent should
have ``ping.nsm`` subagent enabled.

Results of ICMP response statistic collection for primary IP address are visible
in :guilabel:`Object Details -> Overview` and are available as internal
metrics:

* ICMP.ResponseTime.Average
* ICMP.PacketLoss
* ICMP.ResponseTime.Last
* ICMP.ResponseTime.Max
* ICMP.ResponseTime.Min

Results of ICMP response statistic collection for additional targets and
interfaces are available as internal metrics:

* ICMP.ResponseTime.Average(*)
* ICMP.PacketLoss(*)
* ICMP.ResponseTime.Last(*)
* ICMP.ResponseTime.Max(*)
* ICMP.ResponseTime.Min(*)

For example, ``ICMP.PacketLoss(8.8.8.8)`` internal metric will provide packet
loss for target with IP address 8.8.8.8.

No historical data is stored by default. It's necessary to configure DCIs using
above mentioned internal metric to store historical data.


Ping subagent
=============

This subagent can be used to measure ICMP ping response times from one location
to another. When loaded, PING subagent adds a number of metrics to the agent.
Measurements can be either requested by the server or scheduled by the agent
itself. 


Metrics requested by server
---------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 36 64

   * - Metric
     - Description
   * - Icmp.Ping(*target*, *timeout*, *psize*, *dontfragmentflag*, *retrycount*)
     - ICMP ping response time from *target*. Agent will send echo request as
       soon as it receives request for metric's value, and will return
       response time for that particular request. 

       Arguments:

       * *target* should be an IP address or hostname. 
       
       * *timeout* specifies timeout in milliseconds. This is optional argument,
         if omitted, value from *Timeout* configuration parameter will be used.

       * *psize* specifies packet size in bytes, including IP header. This is
         optional argument, if omitted, value from *DefaultPacketSize*
         configuration parameter will be used.

       * *dontfragmentflag* defines if don't fragment flag is set in ICMP
         requests. This is optional argument, if omitted, value from
         DefaultDoNotFragmentFlag configuration parameter will be used.

       * *retrycount* defines number of retries. This is optional argument, if
         omitted, default value of 1 is used. 
       
       Please note that while metrics scheduled by agent just return result of
       background ping process, this metric waits for actual ping completion and
       then returns the result. Because of this behavior, it is not recommended
       to use **Icmp.Ping** metric for regular monitoring, only for
       occasional tests. For instant monitoring, you should configure targets
       for background ping and use **Icmp.AvgPingTime** or **Icmp.LastPingTime**
       metrics to retrieve results.


Metrics scheduled by the agent
------------------------------

There is a number of metrics that are collected based on background ping process
scheduled by the agent (based on "PacketRate" parameter). 

Targets for these metrics can be either defined in agent configuration file
(using one or more "Target" parameters), or registered automatically on first
request from server. If targets are registered automatically, default packet
size is used. First request to non-existing target will return "0" as a value.
Automatically registered targets are automatically removed after a timeout, if
server stops requesting metrics for that target.

Configuration example:

   # This sample nxagentd.conf instructs agent to:
   #   1. load PING subagent
   #   2. Ping target 10.0.0.1 with default size (46 bytes) packets and 10.0.0.2 with 1000 bytes packets
   #   3. Timeout for ping set to 1 second and pings are sent 12 times per minute (each 5 seconds)

   MasterServers = netxms.demo
   SubAgent = ping.nsm

   [PING]
   Timeout = 1000
   PacketRate = 12 # every 5 seconds
   Target = 10.0.0.1:target_1
   Target = 10.0.0.2:target_2:1000

.. note::
  Response time of 10000 indicate timeout
