Log monitoring
==============

With |product_name| you can monitor changes in text log files, Windows Event
Log, and built-in syslog server. All log monitoring done by agents, except for
built-in syslog server. In general, most common log processing goes as
following:

#. When new line added to log file, it is passed to appropriate log parser
#. If line matched one of the patterns, an event associated with this pattern is
   sent to |product_name| server.
#. Server receives event and passes it to event processing policy as usual, with
   event source set to node from which event was received.

For text log files, agent keeps status information about monitored files in
memory only. This means that if the agent was stopped for a period of time,
lines that were added to log file during that time will not be parsed.

For Windows Event Log, agent can keep status information in Windows registry. This function should be explicitly enabled by setting ProcessOfflineEvents = true in LogWatch section. On
agent start records that were added while the agent was stopped will be parsed.

Log parser also provides some additional statistic information through
:term:`Metric`\ s. More information can be found in
:ref:`log-monitoring-parameters` chapter.


Agent Configuration for Log Monitoring
======================================

To be able to monitor logs with |product_name| agent, you should load ``LOGWATCH``
subagent. There are two options to define parser configuration:

#. Create log parser rule XML files on the monitored system and define them
   in ``LOGWATCH`` part of agent configuration.
#. Create log parser agent policy on a template and apply that template to all
   required nodes. This provides graphical editor that allows to specify
   monitored files, conditions and events. Graphical editor automatically
   generates log parser rule XML file that is being uploaded to agents. More
   information about :ref:`agent-policies-label`

Example of agent configuration file:

.. code-block:: ini

   SubAgent = logwatch.nsm

   # Below is log parsers definitions
   [LOGWATCH]
   Parser = C:\log_monitoring_definitions\parser1.xml
   Parser = C:\log_monitoring_definitions\parser2.xml


Syslog Monitoring
=================

|product_name| has built-in syslog server, which can be used to receive logs
from network devices and servers. It is also possible to parse incoming syslog
messages in a way similar to Windows Event Log monitoring. To parse syslog
messages, ``LOGWATCH`` subagent is not required - parsing is done by the server
itself. You only need to define monitoring rules in
:menuselection:`Configuration --> Syslog Parser`


Parser Definition File
======================

Parser definition file is an XML document with the following structure:

.. code-block:: xml

    <parser>
        <file>file name</file>
        <!-- more <file> tags can follow -->
        <macros>
            <macro name="name">macro body</macro>
            <!-- more <macro> tags can follow -->
        </macros>
        <rules>
            <rule>
                <match>regexp</match>
                <id>event id</id>
                <level>severity level</level>
                <source>event source</source>
                <event>event</event>
                <context>context</context>
            </rule>
            <!-- more <rule> tags can follow -->
        </rules>
    </parser>


.. note::

    Entire ``<macros>`` section can be omitted. Empty ``<rule>`` tag will match
    any line (like <rule> <match>.*</match> </rule>).


Global Parser Options
=====================

In the ``<parser>`` tag you can specify the following options:

+------------+------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| Option     | Description                                          | Default value |
+============+======================================================+===============+
| processAll | If this option set to ``1``, parser will always pass | 0             |
|            | log record through all rules. If this option set to  |               |
|            | ``0``, processing will stop after first match.       |               |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| name       | Parser name that is used in statistic information    | *empty*       |
|            | :term:`Metric`\ s. See                               |               |
|            | :ref:`log-monitoring-parameters`                     |               |
|            | for more information.                                |               |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------+---------------+


<file> Tag
==========

In the ``<file>`` tag you should specify full path of log file to apply this
parser to. To specify Windows Event Log, prepend it's name with asterisk
(``*``), for example ``*System``. Multiple ``<file>`` tags can be used - in this
case same rules will be applied to all files.

In the ``<file>`` tag it's possible to use wildcards. Wildcards can be used in
file name, not in directory names in the path. Two wildcard characters are
supported: ``*`` - represents zero, one or multiple characters. ``?`` -
represents any single character.

In file and folder names the following macros can be used:

  - Environment variables as ${ENV_VAR_NAME}
  - `strftime(3C) <http://www.unix.com/man-page/opensolaris/3c/strftime/>`_
    macros (e.g. ``C:\Windows\system32\dhcp\DhcpSrvLog-%a``)
  - Text inside \` braces will be executed as a command and first line of output
    will be taken

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 200 200

   * - Option
     - Description
     - Default value
   * - encoding
     - It is possible to specify the encoding of the log file by adding the
       ``encoding`` attribute. File encodings that can be defined:

            * ``ACP``
            * ``UTF-8``
            * ``UCS-2``
            * ``UCS-2LE``
            * ``UCS-2BE``
            * ``UCS-4``
            * ``UCS-4LE``
            * ``UCS-4BE``

       When using ``UCS-2`` or ``UCS-4`` values, the endianness of the system
       will be detected automatically.

     - By default, the parser will attempt to detect the encoding by scanning
       the file`s BOM.
   * - preallocated
     - Should be set when log file is preallocated (filled with zeros) before
       logs get written into it.
     - 0
   * - snapshot
     - Create VSS snapshot and uses snapshot file for parsing. Can be used when
       log is opened by other application as exclusive open. Windows only. Can
       highly increase CPU usage.
     - 0
   * - keepOpen
     - Defines if the file is kept open or reopened on each parsing iteration.
     - 1
   * - ignoreModificationTime
     - Ignores modification time of log file
     - 0
   * - rescan
     - When file modification is detected, parse the file from it's beginning.
       The file is also parsed on agent startup and when log parsing policy is
       reapplied.

   * - followSymlinks
     - Follow symlinks.
     - 0
   * - removeEscapeSequences
     - Remove `ANSI escape sequences
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>`_ when reading file.

Macros
======

In the ``<macros>`` section you can define macros for use in matching rules. For
example, it can be useful to define macro for a timestamp preceding each log
record and use it in matching rules instead of actual regular expression. You
can define as many macros as you wish, each within it's own ``<macro>`` tag.
Each macro should have unique name, defined in ``name`` attribute, and can be
used in matching rules in form ``@{name}``.

Example: you need to parse log file where each line starts with timestamp in
format ``dd/mm/yy HH:MM:SS``. You can define the following macro:

.. code-block:: xml

    <macros>
        <macro name="timestamp">dd/mm/yy HH:MM:SS</macro>
    </macros>
    <rules>
        <rule>
            <match>@{timestamp}.*([A-Za-z]+) failed.*</match>
            <event>12345</event>
        </rule>
        <rule>
            <match>@{timestamp}.*error.*</match>
            <event>45678</event>
        </rule>
    </rules>

Please note that ``<macros>`` section always should be located before
``<rules>`` section in parser definition file.


Matching rules
==============

In the ``<rules>`` section you define matching rules for log records.

<rule> Tag
-----------

Each rule is placed inside it's own ``<rule>`` tag. Each rule can have
additional options:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 70 15
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description
     - Default value
   * - break
     - If this option set to ``1`` and current line match to regular expression
       in the rule, parser will stop processing of current line, even if global
       parser option ``processAll`` was set to ``1``. If this option set to
       ``0`` (which is default), processing will stop according to
       ``processAll`` option settings.
     - 0
   * - context
     - Name of the context this rule belongs to. If this option is set, rule
       will be processed only if given context was already activated with
       <context> tag in one of the rules processed earlier (it can be either
       same line or one of the previous lines).
     - *empty*
   * - name
     - Name of rule
     - *empty*

Inside the ``<rule>`` section there are the following additional tags:
``<match>``, ``<description>``, ``<event>``, and ``<context>``. Only
``<match>`` section is mandatory - it specifies regular expression against
which log record should be matched. All other tags are optional and define
parser behavior if a record matches the regular expression.


<match> Tag
-----------

Tag ``<match>`` contains a PCRE compliant regular expression that is used to
match log records. Parts enclosed in parenthesis are extracted from log record
and passed as arguments of generated event. You can use macros defined in
:ref:`log-monitoring-macros` section. Also, it is possible to define inverted
match rules (rules when log record considered matching if it does not match
regular expression). Inverted match can be set by setting attribute ``invert``
to ``1``. Other possible option that can be configured is number of times that
expression should be matched to generate event.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: xml

    <match>^Error: (.*)</match>

This regular expression will match any line starting with word ``Error:``, and
everything after this word will be extracted from the log record for use with
an event.

.. code-block:: xml

    <match repeatCount="3" repeatInterval="120" reset="false">[0-9]{3}</match>

This regular expression will match any line containing at least 3 consecutive
digits. And event will be generated only if this regular expression will be
matched 3 or more times in 2 minutes(120 seconds). Matched count won't be reset
once mark is reached, so if expression is matched more than 3 times in 2
minutes, event will be generated more than one time.

.. code-block:: xml

    <match invert="1">abc</match>

This regular expression will match any line not containing character sequence
``abc``.

Possible attributes for tag ``<match>``:

+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| Option         | Description                                              | Default value |
+================+==========================================================+===============+
| invert         | If this option set to ``true``, it will be matched       | false         |
|                | any line that does not contain matching expression.      |               |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| repeatCount    | The number of times expression should be matched         | 0             |
|                | within specified time interval to generate event.        |               |
|                | Actual count is passed to generated event as parameter.  |               |
|                | Setting this option to  ``0`` disables this              |               |
|                | functionality, event will be generated immediately       |               |
|                | on expression match.                                     |               |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| repeatInterval | The time interval during which the expression should     | 1             |
|                | be matched specified number of times.                    |               |
|                |                                                          |               |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+---------------+
| reset          | If this option set to ``true``, the count will be reset  | true          |
|                | on expression match. In order to generate next event,    |               |
|                | ``repeatCount`` number of matches should be accumulated  |               |
|                | again within ``repeatInterval`` time.                    |               |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+---------------+


<id> Tag
--------

Tag ``<id>`` can be used to filter records from Windows Event Log by event ID.
You can specify either single event ID or ID range (by using two numbers
separated with minus sign). For example:


.. code-block:: xml

    <id>7</id>

will match records with event ID equal 7, and

.. code-block:: xml

    <id>10-20</id>

will match records with ID in range from 10 to 20 (inclusive).  This tag has no
effect for text log files, and can be used as a synonym for ``<facility>`` tag
for syslog monitoring.


<source> Tag
------------

Tag ``<source>`` can be used to filter records from Windows Event Log by event
source. You can specify exact event source name or pattern with ``*`` and ``?``
meta characters.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: xml

    <source>Tcpip</source>

will match records with event source ``Tcpip`` (case-insensitive), and

.. code-block:: xml

    <source>X*</source>

will match records with event source started from letter ``X``.  This tag has
no effect for text log files, and can be used as a synonym for ``<tag>`` tag
for syslog monitoring.


<level> Tag
-----------

Tag ``<level>`` can be used to filter records from Windows Event log by event
severity level (also called :guilabel:`event type` in older Windows versions).
Each severity level has it's own numeric value, and to filter by multiple
severity levels you should specify sum of appropriate values (bitmask). Severity
level numerical values are the following:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 80 20

   * - Severity level
     - Decimal value
   * - Error
     - 1
   * - Warning
     - 2
   * - Information
     - 4
   * - Audit Success
     - 8
   * - Audit Failure
     - 16
   * - Critical (only on Windows 7/Windows Server 2008 and higher) 
     - 256


Some examples:

.. code-block:: xml

    <level>1</level>

will match all records with severity level :guilabel:`Error`, and

.. code-block:: xml

    <level>6</level>

will match all records with severity level :guilabel:`Warning` or
:guilabel:`Information`.  This tag has no effect for text log files, and can be
used as a synonym for ``<severity>`` tag for syslog monitoring.


<facility> Tag
--------------

Tag ``<facility>`` can be used to filter syslog records (received by |product_name|
built-in syslog server) by facility code. The following facility codes can be
used:

+--------+------------------------------------------+
|   Code |     Facility                             |
+========+==========================================+
|  0     | kernel messages                          |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  1     | user-level messages                      |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  2     | mail system                              |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  3     | system daemons                           |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  4     | security/authorization messages          |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  5     | messages generated internally by syslogd |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  6     | line printer subsystem                   |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  7     | network news subsystem                   |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  8     | UUCP subsystem                           |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  9     | clock daemon                             |

|  16    | local use 0 (local0)                     |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  17    | local use 1 (local1)                     |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  18    | local use 2 (local2)                     |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  19    | local use 3 (local3)                     |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  20    | local use 4 (local4)                     |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  21    | local use 5 (local5)                     |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  22    | local use 6 (local6)                     |
+--------+------------------------------------------+
|  23    | local use 7 (local7)                     |
+--------+------------------------------------------+


You can specify either single facility code or facility code range (by using
two numbers separated by minus sign). For example:

.. code-block:: xml

   <facility>7</facility>

will match records with facility code equal 7, and

.. code-block:: xml

   <facility>10-20</facility>

will match records with facility code in range from 10 to 20 (inclusive).  This
tag has no effect for text log files, and can be used as a synonym for ``<id>``
tag for Windows Event Log monitoring.


<tag> Tag
---------

Tag ``<tag>`` can be used to filter syslog records (received by |product_name|
built-in syslog server) by content of ``tag`` field. You can specify exact value
or pattern with ``*`` and ``?`` meta characters.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: xml

    <tag>httpd</tag>

will match records with tag "httpd" (case-insensitive), and

.. code-block:: xml

    <tag>X*</tag>

will match records with tag started from letter ``X``.  This tag has no effect
for text log files, and can be used as a synonym for ``<source>`` tag for
Windows Event Log monitoring.


<severity> Tag
--------------

Tag ``<severity>`` can be used to filter syslog records (received by
|product_name| built-in syslog server) by severity level. Each severity level
has it's own code, and to filter by multiple severity levels you should specify
sum of appropriate codes. Severity level codes are following:


+------+---------------+
| Code |  Severity     |
+======+===============+
| 1    | Emergency     |
+------+---------------+
| 2    | Alert         |
+------+---------------+
| 4    | Critical      |
+------+---------------+
| 8    | Error         |
+------+---------------+
| 16   | Warning       |
+------+---------------+
| 32   | Notice        |
+------+---------------+
| 64   | Informational |
+------+---------------+
| 128  | Debug         |
+------+---------------+


Some examples:

.. code-block:: xml

    <severity>1</severity>

will match all records with severity level :guilabel:`Emergency`, and

.. code-block:: xml

    <severity>6</severity>

will match all records with severity level :guilabel:`Alert` or
:guilabel:`Critical`. This tag has no effect for text log files, and can be
used as a synonym for ``<level>`` tag for Windows Event Log monitoring.


<description> Tag
-----------------

Tag ``<description>`` contains textual description of the rule.


<event> Tag
-----------

Tag ``<event>`` defines event to be generated if current log record match to
regular expression defined in ``<match>`` tag. Inside ``<event>`` tag you should
specify event name or event code to be generated. All matched capture groups
will be given to the event as an event parameters.

Event tag has ``tag`` attribute. If the attribute is set, then it will be added to
the selected event tag list.


<context> Tag
-------------

Tag ``<context>`` defines activation or deactivation of contexts. This option
can be used for multi line match. First line sets context and next generates
event in case if context was set. Examples can be found further in
:ref:`log_parser_examles` section.

It has the following format:

.. code-block:: xml

   <context action="action" reset="reset mode">context name</context>

Possible actions are:

+--------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Action | Description                                        |
+========+====================================================+
| clear  | Deactivate (clear "active" flag of) given context. |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------+
| set    | Activate (set "active" flag of) given context.     |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------+
| reset  | Defines how context will be deactivated            |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------+

Possible values for reset mode are:

+------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Reset mode | Description                                           |
+============+=======================================================+
| auto       | Deactivate context automatically after first match    |
|            | in context (match rule with ``context`` attribute set |
|            | to given context).                                    |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| manual     | Context can be deactivated only by explicit           |
|            | ``<context action="clear">`` statement.               |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

Both ``action`` and ``reset`` attributes can be omitted; default value for
``action`` is ``set``, and default value for ``reset`` is ``auto``.


<exclusionSchedules> Tag
------------------------

Tag ``<exclusionSchedules>`` defines time when file should not be parsed. Each
cron expression should be defined in ``<schedule>``. This should be used to
define time when file should not be opened. Once time does not match cron file
will be reopened and all added lines will be parsed. See :ref:`cron_format` for
supported cron format options.

Example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <parser>
        <file>/var/log/messages</file>
        <rules>
            <rule>
                <match>error</match>
                <event>USR_APP_ERROR</event>
            </rule>
        </rules>
        <exclusionSchedules>
            <schedule>0-2 0 * * *</schedule>
        </exclusionSchedules>
    </parser>

Examples of Parser Definition File
==================================

Generate event with name ``USR_APP_ERROR`` if line in the log file /var/log/messages
contains word error:

.. code-block:: xml

    <parser>
        <file>/var/log/messages</file>
        <rules>
            <rule>
                <match>error</match>
                <event>USR_APP_ERROR</event>
            </rule>
        </rules>
    </parser>

Generate event with name ``SYS_PROCESS_START_FAILED`` if line in the log file
``C:\demo.log`` contains word ``process:`` and is immediately following line
containing text ``process startup failed``; everything after word ``process:``
will be sent as event's parameter:

.. code-block:: xml

    <parser>
        <file>C:\demo.log</file>
        <rules>
            <rule>
                <match>process startup failed</match>
                <context action="set" reset="auto">STARTUP_FAILED</context>
            </rule>
            <rule context="STARTUP_FAILED">
                <match>process:(.*)</match>
                <event>SYS_PROCESS_START_FAILED</event>
            </rule>
        </rules>
    </parser>


Passing parameters to events
============================

The log parser adds parameters to events. For non-Windows platforms the
following parameters are provided:

+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Number   | Description                                           |
+==========+=======================================================+
| 1 to n   | Capture groups                                        |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| n+1      | Event tag (if set in log parser policy configuration, | 
|          | otherwise this field is omitted)                      |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| n+2      | Repeat count - how many times this rule was matched   |
|          | previously.                                           |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

For Windows the following parameters are provided:

+----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Number   | Description                                        |
+==========+====================================================+
| 1 to n   | Capture groups                                     |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| n+1      | Event tag (if set in log parser policy             | 
|          | configuration, otherwise this field is omitted)    |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| n+2      | Windows publisher name                             |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| n+3      | Windows event id                                   |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| n+4      | Windows severity                                   |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| n+5      | Windows record Id                                  |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| n+6      | Repeat count - how many times this rule was        |
|          | matched previously.                                |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+
| n+7 to k | Windows event strings                              |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------+

Consider the following line is received via syslog, or added to a monitored file:

.. code-block:: 

    24.04.2015 12:22:15 1 5 system,error,critical login failure for user
    testUser from 11.2.33.41 via ssh

We can extract username and login method from the syslog message, and pass it as
parameters to an event with the following rule:

.. code-block:: xml

    <match>system,error,critical login failure for user (.*) from .* via
    (.*)</match> <event>10000</event>

Username will be sent to the event as %1, IP address will not be sent, and login
method will be sent as %2.

Log parser metrics
==================

Log parser provides some additional statistic information through
:term:`Metric`\ s. Metrics take name of particular parser as an argument. If
name is not set, then file name is used.

Statistic information is reset on agent startup and when log parser policy is
reapplied.

Available metrics:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 150
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Metric Name
     - Description
   * - LogWatch.Parser.Status(*name*)
     - Parser *name* status
   * - LogWatch.Parser.MatchedRecords(*name*)
     - Number of records matched by parser *name*
   * - LogWatch.Parser.ProcessedRecords(*name*)
     - Number of records processed by parser *name*

Available lists:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 150
   :header-rows: 1

   * - List Name
     - Description
   * - LogWatch.ParserList
     - List of parser names. If no name is defined then parser file name will be
       used.
