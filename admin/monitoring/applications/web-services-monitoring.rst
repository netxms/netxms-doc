Data Collection from Web Services
=================================

|product_name| has a built-in data collection mechanism using web services,
allowing to extract data for DCIs from JSON, XML, or plain text responses to
HTTP requests. Data collection from web services is done via the |product_name|
agent. If zoning is not used (or for the Default zone), the agent running on the NetXMS
server is used. If zoning is used, zone proxies are used (and if a zone has no
proxies configured, the agent on NetXMS server is used as last resort).


Configuring Web Service Data collection
=======================================

Agent configuration
-------------------

Starting from version 3.8 of the |product_name| agent, data collection from web
services is disabled by default. To enable it, add ``EnableWebServiceProxy=yes``
to the agent configuration file and restart the agent.

Web service definitions
-----------------------

Common configuration related to multiple metrics and nodes is set up in the
web service definition editor accessible via the
:guilabel:`Configuration -> Web Service Definitions` menu.

.. figure:: ../../_images/web_service_definition_general.png

The following parameters can be configured:

* Web service name
* Web service URL
* Additional HTTP headers
* Authentication data (authentication type, login, password)
* Cache retention time (in seconds)
* Request timeout (in seconds)

The web service URL and additional HTTP headers fields can contain macros that are
expanded when the actual request is made. So you can, for example, set the URL as ``%{url}``
and keep the actual URL in a custom attribute of the node with the name ``url``.

DCI Configuration
-----------------

DCI configuration provides the DCI origin "web service". Metric name for this origin
contains the web service definition name with optional arguments and the path to
the document element that has to be retrieved, or a PCRE compliant regex with one
capture group for text responses.

For example:
   * ``WebService1:/system/cpu/usage``
   * ``WebService2(eth0):/stat/bytesIn``
   * ``WebService3(10,20,30):^(\d*)``

Service arguments can be inserted into the request URL or headers using macros %1,
%2, and so on.
For XML and JSON responses, the path to the document element should start with ``/``.
An XML response, according to the standard, should only have one upper level tag.
For text responses, the first capture group of the regular expression is returned.

Instance discovery
------------------

For web service discovery the “Web Service” instance discovery method can be used.
It accepts a web service name with optional arguments and the path to the root
element of the document where enumeration will start. Each sub-element of a given
root element will be considered as a separate instance.

For example:
   * ``WebService1:/system/cpu`` will enumerate all elements under "/system/cpu"
   * ``WebService2(eth0):/stat`` will enumerate all elements under "/stat"


Data collection process
=======================

The data collection process from the server point of view is:

1. The server finds the web service definition by the given name, passes any parameters to
it, and gets back the URL and headers with all macros expanded.

2. The server determines the agent to be used for the request based on zone settings, node
settings, agent availability, etc.

3. The server sends the request to the selected agent. A request consists of an URL, headers,
and document path.

4. The server waits for a response from the agent and processes the retrieved data similar to any
other DCI type. For instance, the discovery server provides a new instance
discovery method - “web service” which accepts a web service name with
optional arguments and path to the root element of the document where
enumeration will start. Each sub-element of the given root element will be
considered a separate instance.

Actual requests and response parsing is implemented on the agent level. This
provides the necessary flexibility for accessing services not directly reachable
from the management server as well as offloads response parsing from the server to
agents.

The data collection process from the agent point of view is:

1. The agent receives a web service request (URL, authentication data, headers) and
list of elements to retrieve from the server.

2. The agent checks the document cache if the requested URL was already retrieved and data
is within configured cache retention time. If so, values of the requested elements
from cached data are returned to the server.

3. The agent performs an HTTP request using the provided service data. If the request is
successfully retrieved, the document is parsed into tree form and values of the requested
elements are returned to the server. No additional configuration should be required on the
agent side.


Examples
========

This example shows how to use the same web service JSON output for instances and
then to collect data.

We assume that the configuration is already done and we have a web service with
the "WebService1" name, that returns a JSON data structure as:

.. code-block:: json

   [
      {
         "name": "Object1",
         "status": "Online",
         "position": "Front"
      },
      {
         "name": "Object2",
         "position": "Back"
      },
      {
         "name": "Object3",
         "status": "Ofline",
         "position": "Front"
      }
   ]

Form this JSON document we want to get a separate DCI for each object. We will collect
status if exist and will set status to Ofline if the object does not contain status
parameter.

The DCI will have the following configuration:

   * Instance discovery method: Web Service
   * Web service request: WebService1:[.[].name]

     This will create an array with names. Each name will be taken as an instance:

          .. code-block:: json

             ["Object1", "Object2", "Object3"]

   * Origin: Web service
   * Metric: (.[] | select(.name == "{instance}").status ) // "failed"

     This configuration will get the status for the object with name like {instance}
     (will be replaced by its real name on instance discovery) and it will return
     "failed" if this object does not contain the status field.
