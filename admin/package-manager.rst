Package management

Introduction
============

The package management functionality can upload and execute installers via the
|product_name| agent. This allows to perform centralized upgrade of the
|product_name| agent, to install other software or upload and extract archive files
onto target systems. 

To access package management, open the :guilabel:`Configuration` perspective and
select :guilabel:`Packages`. Software packages are first uploaded to the
|product_name| server. In order to do this, select :guilabel:`Upload to server`
and select a file. 

For some types of packages, the additional dialog :guilabel:`Edit Package Metadata`
is displayed. This allows to specify additional metadata for a package. Whenever
possible, metadata information is filled in automatically based on information
contained in file name.

You can open the metadata editor by double-clicking on a package in the list. In
the metadata editor `Name`, `Version` and `Description` are just informative fields,
they are not used in package processing. 

`Platform` denotes for which platforms a package is applicable. The actual platform
of a node is compared to this field as string value using wildcard characters.
Two wildcard characters are supported: ``*`` - represents zero, one or multiple
characters. ``?`` - represents any single character. Setting `Platform` to ``*``
would mean any platform. ``Linux*`` would mean both 32 and 64 bit Linuxes.

`Type` defines package type. This defines how the agent should process the package
when installing it. The meaning of the `Command` field depends on the package type. See
information in the table below. 

The following types of package files are supported by package management:

To deploy a package, select one or several nodes from :guilabel:`Infrastructure
services` or :guilabel:`Entire Network`. You can also select containers or
subnets. Right-click on the selected items and select :guilabel:`Deploy
package...`. Select the package and click :guilabel:`OK`. 

During the package deployment process, the server will request the platform name from agent
and check if it matches `Platform` from the package metadata. The deployment process
is shown in the :guilabel:`Package deployment monitor` tab that is visible on all
relevant containers, subnets and nodes.
