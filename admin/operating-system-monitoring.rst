Operating System Monitoring
===========================

Most OS-related metrics (file system, CPU, network) are provided by
"platform subagent", which is loaded automatically by the agent on the startup.

List of available subagents:

  * linux
  * aix
  * hpux
  * winnt (all Windows flavors)
  * sunos (Solaris)
  * darwin (MacOS)
  * freebsd
  * netbsd
  * openbsd

In this section we cover only most common metrics.
:ref:`Detailed list <list-of-supported-metrics>` available bellow.

Example
=======

In examples will be shown only DCI configuration with threshold. Generated event
processing options can be found in :ref:`event-processing` chapter.

Process monitoring
------------------

In this example monitoring of running "mysqld" process will be configured and one
threshold will be added: when process count is less then 1 (process is not running).

Create DCI for Process.Count(*) metric to monitor "mysqld" process count.

.. figure:: _images/os-metric-process-monitoring.png

Create threshold. It will be triggered when process count is not equal to 1(process is
not running). As prerequisite it was created 2 events.

  Events

.. figure:: _images/os-metric-process-monitoring3.png

  Threshold 1

As in message of error is used Instance parameter, it should be set in
:guilabel:`Threshold` window.

Disk free space monitoring
--------------------------

In this example monitoring of free space in percents for / disk will be configured and
two thresholds will be added: when disk space less then 15% and less then 7%.


Create DCI for FileSystem.FreePerc(*) metric to monitor space on /.

.. figure:: _images/os-metric-disk-free-space-example.png

Create 2 thresholds. One will be triggered when free space is less than 15% and other
one when free space is less than 7%. Before threshold creation was created 3 events:

  Events

.. figure:: _images/os-metric-disk-free-space-example3.png

  Threshold 1

.. figure:: _images/os-metric-disk-free-space-example4.png

  Threshold 2

As in message of error is used Instance parameter, it should be set in
:guilabel:`Threshold` window.

.. figure:: _images/os-metric-disk-free-space-example5.png

  Both

CPU usage
---------

This example will show how to configure monitoring of CPU usage and create event when
CPU usage is more than 90% for more than 5 minutes.

Create DCI for System.CPU.LoadAvg metric.

.. figure:: _images/os-metric-cpu-usage-example.png

Create threshold that will create event in case if last 5 values are more than 90
(last 5 minutes CPU usage is more than 90%).

.. _WMI-subagent:



WMI
---


`Windows Management Instrumentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation>`_ 
subagent provides interface to Windows Driver Model and thus enables information and notification gathering and further manipulation for monitoring purpose.  

Configuration example:

.. code-block:: cfg

   MasterServers = netxms.demo
   SubAgent=wmi.nsm


Provides access to WMI data via WMI class queries. In below example, DCI :guilabel:`New table ...` is created 
with NetXMS Agent as Origin and WMI query as Metric
